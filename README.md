### Submission

1. When time is called, `git add` and `git commit` if you haven't already, then `git push` *on your branch*. You will never be able to push to `master`; you will not be able to push to your own branch before time is called. If you're done before time, make a commit (don't push it) and continue working on stretch features. If you break something, you can go back to your working commit.
2. Make a pull request from your branch to `master`. Copy and paste the link to your pull request into the text box on <http://learn.co/assignments> for the code challenge task. Submit.
3. Eat something nice for lunch and relax. *Do not* talk to fellow students, students in other mods, or anyone about the code challenge. Your instructors will give you feedback on your work in the afternoon.
